In this case, the oxen are harnessed, indicating their domestication, unlike the donkey. Furthermore, the corpse is not in direct contact with the animal in the first scenario, whereas in the second, it is placed on it in an unstable manner. All of this effectively demonstrates that it is through virtue that humans restore divine order and stability. Indeed, symbolically for medieval society, the use of animals serves as a practical means to keep animals at a distance from humans and to restore the Edenic order",
